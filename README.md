# C++ Interview

## Introduction
Welcome to our technical interview process! 

In this interview, we'd like to assess your skills in C++. We expect the exercise to take roughly 2-3 hours.

## Exercise

You'll be asked to submit some code for an application that tackles three specific questions using the data provided in _data.json_ in this repo.

### Question 1
    
For a given node in the graph, its **weighted degree** is the sum of the weights of all links connected to the node.

Write a program to compute the **weighted degree** of each node of the graph, and order the nodes by their weighted degree. The program should print its output to stdout in the following format
  
highest scoring node name:          score  
second highest scoring node name:   score  
.  
.  
.  
  
### Question 2
  
How do you think the method of question 1 performs as a definition of importance for the nodes in the graph? (What does it do well? What are its shortcomings?)
  
### Question 3
  
Based on your answer to question 2, and your own research, determine a better method of assigning an "importance score" to each node in the graph, and write a program to implement it (again printing its output to stdout, in the same format as question 1). Give a brief description of how the chosen method works, and if it has a name, say what it is.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
* **Functionality:** Does your code accomplish the tasks specified in a functional manner?
* **Code Quality:** Is your code well-structured, readable, and maintainable? Are best practices followed?

## Additional Information
* All of the necessary data for the tasks can be found in _data.json_ in this repo, so you do not need to worry about data generation.
* You are free to use any libraries or tools you prefer to complete the tasks.
* Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or need clarification during the interview process.

We look forward to reviewing your submission and assessing your skills in C++ development. Good luck with your interview, and we appreciate your interest in joining our team!
